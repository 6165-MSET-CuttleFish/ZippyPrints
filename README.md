# Zippyprints

ZippyPrints was created by 6165 MSET Cuttlefish, a FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) robotics team, to connect FTC teams with 3D printers with underresourced teams needing custom manufacturing services to create custom parts they design. Through ZippyPrints, our team hopes to provide more learning opportunities and increase the competitiveness of traditionally underepresented teams in not only FTC teams, but teams from all competitions. Individuals who require custom parts for their personal or professional projects can benefit as well!
